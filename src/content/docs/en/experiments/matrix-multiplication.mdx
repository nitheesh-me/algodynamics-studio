## Mulitply and add Randomly

The Multiply and Add Randomly Machine is a simple machine that multiplies/adds any two elements randomly selected from different arrays.
Below you can select any two elements and add/multiply them.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="machine">
    <MultiplyAddRandomMachine elements={[5, 3, 8, 1, 2]} client:load />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Mulitply and Add Inorder

The aim is to find the Dot Product of two arrays by multiplying two elements having same indices from each array and adding them to output.
Below you can select the numbers and find the Dot Product.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="machine">
    <MultipleAddInorderMachine elements={[5, 3, 8, 1, 2]} client:load />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Dot Product Sequentially

The aim is to find the Dot Product of two arrays by multiplying two elements having same indices sequentially from each array and adding them to output.
Below you can select the numbers and find the Dot Product.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="machine">
    <DotProductSequential elements={[5, 3, 8, 1, 2]} client:load />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
