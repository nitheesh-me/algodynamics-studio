# Graph Traversal

<PreCheck>
  - Understand how Graph Traversal.
</PreCheck>

We present a series of interactive experiments to help you understand the Graph Traversal algorithms.

</Steps>

## Breadth First Search

The aim is to find the Dot Product of two arrays by multiplying two elements having same indices sequentially from each array and adding them to output.
Below you can select the numbers and find the Dot Product.

### Test your knowledge

1. Can you select two elements in the array and swap them using the Swap Machine?

    <MultipleChoice>
      <Option isCorrect>
        Yes
      </Option>
      <Option>
        No
      </Option>
    </MultipleChoice>

2. Can you order two elements in the array in accending order using the Order Machine?

    <MultipleChoice>
      <Option isCorrect>
        Yes
      </Option>
      <Option>
        No
      </Option>
    </MultipleChoice>

3. Can you sort the array using only swaps?

    <MultipleChoice>
      <Option isCorrect>
        Yes
      </Option>
      <Option>
        No
      </Option>
