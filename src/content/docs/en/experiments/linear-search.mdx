# Linear Search

<PreCheck>
  - Understand how Linear Search works.
</PreCheck>

We present a series of interactive experiments to help you understand the Linear Search algorithm.

Interactive Abstract Machines for Linear Search

2. [Iterative Selection Machine]()
</Steps>

## Random Selection Machine

The Swap Machine is a simple machine that swaps two elements in an array. It is the basic building block for the Bubblesort algorithm.

Below you can select any two elements in the array and swap them.
